# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles, feel free to browse.

## Installing

Be VERY careful when you want to just blindly copy this configuration -- I've
ignored a few files which you may or may not need. This is to avoid bloating the
repository unnecessarily.

Carefully read the files and, if present, folder READMEs to get a grip of what
you need to do.
